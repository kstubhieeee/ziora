# Ziora - Academic Resource Management Platform

A comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline academic resource management for engineering students. Ziora provides a centralized platform for accessing course materials, video lectures, previous year questions, practical guides, and syllabus content across different academic years and branches.

## Project Overview

Ziora is built to solve the common problem of scattered academic resources in engineering education. The platform organizes content systematically by academic year, semester, branch, and subject, making it easy for students to find exactly what they need for their studies.

- **Package Management**: npm with lock file for dependency consistency

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### **File-based Routing**
- Utilizes Next.js App Router for intuitive URL structure
- Dynamic routing for academic hierarchy: `/select/[year]/[semester]/[branch]/subjects/[subjectName]/[contentType]`
- Nested layouts for consistent UI across related pages

### **Component Architecture**
- **Atomic Design**: Reusable UI components in `components/ui/`
- **Feature Components**: Page-specific components for complex functionality
- **Layout Components**: Consistent navigation and structure

### **State Management**
- **Server State**: Next.js API routes with MongoDB integration
- **Client State**: React hooks and context for UI state
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex form management

### **Data Organization**
- **JSON Configuration**: Structured data files for academic content organization
- **MongoDB Collections**: User management, content metadata, and analytics
- **File Storage**: Organized content delivery system

## Key Accomplishments

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for optimal loading
- **Bundle Analysis**: Optimized dependencies and tree shaking

### **User Experience**
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading indicators and skeleton screens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error boundaries and user feedback
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components with keyboard navigation

### **Security Implementation**
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitized user inputs and secure rendering
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse
- **Secure Headers**: Next.js security headers configuration

## Impact & Metrics
